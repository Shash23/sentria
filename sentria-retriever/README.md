# Sentria Retriever

**Overview**

The Sentria Retriever is a crucial component of the Sentria platform, responsible for indexing telemetry data into a vector database. This enables efficient retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for logs, metrics, and traces, allowing users to query system behavior using natural language.

---

## Features

- Indexes telemetry data from various sources into a vector database (e.g., Qdrant or Weaviate).
- Supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the quality of responses generated by the AI component.
- Provides utility functions for data processing and transformation.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the `sentria-retriever` directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that the vector database (Qdrant or Weaviate) is set up and accessible.

## Usage

To index telemetry data, run the following command:

```
python src/index_telemetry.py
```

This script will process the telemetry data and store it in the configured vector database.

## Development

### Directory Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the retriever component.
  - `index_telemetry.py`: Script for indexing telemetry data.
  - `vectorizer.py`: Functions for vectorizing telemetry data.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions for the retriever component.

### Testing

Ensure to write unit tests for the functions in `vectorizer.py` and `utils.py` to maintain code quality and reliability.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Implement support for additional telemetry data sources.
- Optimize indexing performance and reduce latency.
- Enhance error handling and logging mechanisms.
